# IBM Recommendation Engines


# Project Objective
In this project, I aim to analyze user interactions with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform and provide personalized article recommendations. By studying the available data on the platform, I will identify patterns and preferences to suggest new articles that users are likely to enjoy.


# Below is the table of contents outlining the various methods used to create recommendations for different scenarios:
I. [Exploratory Data Analysis](#Exploratory-Data-Analysis)
II. [Rank-Based Recommendations](#Rank)
III. [User-User Collaborative Filtering](#User-User)
IV. [Content-Based Recommendations (EXTRA - NOT REQUIRED)](#Content-Recs)
V. [Matrix Factorization](#Matrix-Fact)
VI. [Extras & Conclusions](#conclusions)


# Libraries Utilized
pandas as pd, numpy as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, project_tests as t, pickle and seaborn as sns
